About
======

Bird Banding Codes are widely used by by scientist, field ornithologists, and everyday birders. This API will (hopefully) assist in translating any bird band code into a full species name.

Examples
========

Banding Codes are four-letter codes that represent specific species. 

For example, the Blue Jay has a banding code of BLJA, a contraction of the first two letters of each word in the species name. 

Due to collisions, however, this method doesn't work for all species, and sometimes requires special rules that are hard to memorise. For example, the Cedar Waxwing and Cerulean Warbler would have the same code, so two seperate codes were devised, CEDW, and CERW respectively.
